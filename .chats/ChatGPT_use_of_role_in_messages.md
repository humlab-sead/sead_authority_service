## User
Describe the use of "role" when in the "messages" items when using ChatGPT API.

## ChatGPT
In the **ChatGPT (or OpenAI) API**, the `"role"` field is an essential part of each message in the `messages` array that you send to or receive from the model. It defines **who is speaking** in the conversation and controls how the model interprets and responds to the content.

Here’s a detailed explanation:

🧩 Structure of the `messages` Array
------------------------------------

A typical request to the ChatGPT API looks like this:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write me a short poem about autumn."}
  ]
}
```

Each item in the `"messages"` array represents one conversational turn.  
The `"role"` specifies the **speaker’s identity or function** in that turn.


🎭 The Four Roles
-----------------

### 1\. `"system"`

*   **Purpose:** Sets the **behavior, tone, or identity** of the assistant.
*   **Who uses it:** You (the developer) define it at the start of the conversation.
*   **Effect:** The model treats this as an instruction about how it should behave throughout the chat.
    

**Example:**

```json
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a formal research assistant who provides detailed, academic-style answers."}
```

### 2\. `"user"`

*   **Purpose:** Represents input or questions from the **end user**.
*   **Who uses it:** Typically, the person interacting with the assistant.
*   **Effect:** The model interprets this as what it needs to respond to.

**Example:**

```json
{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the role of mitochondria in simple terms."}
```

### 3\. `"assistant"`

*   **Purpose:** Contains the **model’s responses** in the conversation.
*   **Who uses it:** Usually the API or application when storing or replaying conversation history.
*   **Effect:** Provides context — helps the model remember what it previously said.
    

**Example:**

```json
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell..."}
```

### 4\. `"tool"` (and previously `"function"`)

*   **Purpose:** Represents the **output from a tool or function call** that the model invoked.
*   **Who uses it:** The application or system — not the end user.
*   **Effect:** Gives the model access to structured tool results so it can continue reasoning or responding.
    

**Example:**

```json
{"role": "tool", "content": "{\"temperature\": 15, \"conditions\": \"sunny\"}"}
```

In older API versions (before 2024), `"function"` was used instead of `"tool"`.  
Now `"tool"` is the standard for representing structured outputs from external systems or code.

🧠 How the Roles Work Together
------------------------------

Here’s how roles shape the conversation flow:

| Role | Who Speaks | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| system | Developer | Set rules, personality, or goals |
| user | End User | Ask questions or give instructions |
| assistant | Model | Provide answers or reasoning |
| tool | External Tool | Return results from a tool the model used |

**Example Conversation:**

```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a weather assistant."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me check that for you."},
  {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"city\": \"Paris\", \"temp_c\": 19, \"condition\": \"clear skies\"}"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's 19°C and clear in Paris right now."}
]
```

⚙️ Summary
----------

*   **`system`** – defines how the model behaves
*   **`user`** – provides input from the user
*   **`assistant`** – stores or returns model responses
*   **`tool`** – represents structured tool/function output

Would you like an example showing how to use `"role"` together with `"tool_calls"` (e.g., when the assistant calls an external API and uses the result)?
